# Best Practices for Reliable Model Deployment

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide provides practical, step-by-step recommendations to help you select suitable FastVLM model checkpoints, manage large model downloads efficiently, and ensure reproducible deployments across different operating environments.

### Prerequisites
- Familiarity with FastVLM pretrained model checkpoints and their staging (e.g., stages 2 and 3).
- Access to the internet for downloading model checkpoints.
- A configured FastVLM environment prepared for loading and running models (refer to the [Installation & Environment Setup](https://github.com/apple/ml-fastvlm) and [Downloading Pretrained Models](/getting-started/setup-local-inference/download-models) guides).
- Basic understanding of your target device or platform specifications.

### Expected Outcome
- Confident selection of FastVLM checkpoints matching your use case and resource constraints.
- Efficient handling of large model files with strategies to minimize download interruptions.
- Consistent and reproducible model deployment across different systems and environments.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 15 to 30 minutes depending on download speeds and environment setup status.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate - requires understanding model versions, deployment environments, and system resource considerations.

## 1. Selecting Appropriate Model Checkpoints

FastVLM offers multiple pretrained checkpoints across different model sizes (0.5B, 1.5B, 7B) and fine-tuning stages (Stage 2 and Stage 3).

### Step 1: Understand Your Use Case and Resources
- **Mobile or Resource-constrained devices:** Choose smaller models like FastVLM-0.5B to minimize memory and compute usage.
- **High accuracy and richer language capabilities:** Larger models such as FastVLM-7B or FastVLM-1.5B offer enhanced performance.

### Step 2: Select the Checkpoint Stage
- **Stage 2 Checkpoints:** Typically intermediate fine-tuning, suitable for baseline experiments.
- **Stage 3 Checkpoints:** Generally the most refined models with advanced fine-tuning for best accuracy.

### Step 3: Confirm File Compatibility
- If deploying on Apple Silicon devices, use the Apple Siliconâ€“compatible checkpoints with CoreML exports available or export your own following the [Apple Silicon Export guide](/getting-started/apple-device-inference/apple-silicon-export).


## 2. Efficiently Managing Large Checkpoint Downloads

Large model files can be tens of gigabytes. Follow these practical tips to ensure reliable downloads:

- **Use Provided Download Scripts:** Utilize FastVLM's `get_models.sh` script which automates downloading and verification.

- **Validate Checkpoint Integrity:** After download, confirm the files are intact before usage. The script usually verifies checksums.

- **Use Download Managers:** For unstable connections, use robust tools (e.g., `aria2`) that support resume and parallel connections.

- **Plan Storage Needs:** Ensure sufficient disk space to accommodate fully expanded checkpoint files.

- **Avoid Partial Checkpoint Use:** Do not attempt to run inference with incomplete checkpoints; this leads to load failures or corrupted models.

## 3. Maintaining Reproducibility Across Operating Environments

Model deployment consistency is critical, especially across platforms like Linux, macOS (including Apple Silicon), and Windows.

### Step 1: Pin Software Versions
- Use virtual environments or containers to lock Python versions, dependencies, and PyTorch versions.
- September 2024 standard is Python 3.10 with appropriate PyTorch and Transformers versions (check [Prerequisites & System Requirements](/getting-started/setup-local-inference/prerequisites)).

### Step 2: Match Model Loading Settings
- When loading FastVLM checkpoints, ensure the device (e.g., `cuda`, `mps`, or CPU) is specified consistently to prevent unexpected behavior.
- Use the `load_pretrained_model` method's device and precision flags accurately for stable results.

### Step 3: Control Model Parameters and Random Seeds
- For training or fine-tuning, set explicit random seeds and consistent batch sizes.
- For inference, keep generation parameters like `temperature`, `top_p`, and `max_new_tokens` consistent per deployment.

### Step 4: Use Fixed Versions of Checkpoint Files
- Do not mix model files from different stages or checkpoints; keep each deployment consistent with a known, stable checkpoint.

### Step 5: Export and Use Platform-Specific Models
- For Apple Silicon, export using the `export_vision_encoder.py` script and convert using the patched `mlx-vlm` tool.
- Follow detailed instructions at [Model Export for Apple Silicon](model_export/README.md).

### Step 6: Record Deployment Metadata
- Store metadata around model versions, configuration, and environment details alongside your deployment to aid troubleshooting and exact reproduction.

## Examples & Patterns

### Example: Selecting and Running a FastVLM Model
Run inference on a moderate compute platform with the 1.5B Stage 3 checkpoint:

```bash
python predict.py \
  --model-path ./checkpoints/fastvlm_1.5b_stage3 \
  --image-file ./examples/image.png \
  --prompt "Describe the image." \
  --conv-mode qwen_2 \
  --temperature 0.2
```

Expected: The model will load the 1.5B Stage 3 checkpoint and output a descriptive text.

### Pattern: Managing Large Model Downloads

```
# Execute the download script
bash get_models.sh

# If failure occurs, use aria2 with resume:
aria2c -c -x 16 -s 16 <model_url>

# Verify size and hash after download
sha256sum fastvlm_1.5b_stage3.zip
```

### Example: Exporting for Apple Silicon

```bash
# Export the vision encoder
python export_vision_encoder.py --model-path ./checkpoints/fastvlm_1.5b_stage3

# Convert LLM for Apple Silicon
python -m mlx_vlm.convert --hf-path ./checkpoints/fastvlm_1.5b_stage3 \
                          --mlx-path ./exported_fastvlm_1.5b_stage3 \
                          --only-llm \
                          -q --q-bits 8
```

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Checkpoint Load Failures">
- **Cause:** Corrupted or partial checkpoint files.
- **Solution:** Redownload with verification. Use stable scripts like `get_models.sh`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mismatch in Environment Configuration">
- **Cause:** Different PyTorch or Transformers versions.
- **Solution:** Pin dependencies, use Conda or virtualenv, confirm versions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Inconsistent Outputs Across Devices">
- **Cause:** Differing precision modes (`float16` vs `bfloat16`), device mismatch.
- **Solution:** Fix generation parameters and loading devices explicitly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Large File Storage and I/O Bottlenecks">
- **Cause:** Slow disks or insufficient space causing read/write failures.
- **Solution:** Use SSDs, verify disk space, and avoid simultaneous large file operations.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
For Apple Silicon deployment, always ensure the exported model and vision encoder have matching configurations and proper quantization. Run the provided test inference to verify correctness before full integration.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Use version control or metadata tagging to cache model checkpoint versions and export dates for traceability.
